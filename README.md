# XenDesktopCloudResourceCreation
This Repo provides Arm Template to setup a Resource Location in Azure, which creates and configures  VDI, CloudConnector, Domain Controller and Netscaler.


This template demonstrates the creation of a self-contained XenApp environment in Azure, creating the following resources:

* Domain Controller
* XenApp Desktop Delivery Controller with SQL Express, Citrix License Server, Citrix Director, Citrix Storefront
* Citrix NetScaler
* Citrix Virtual Desktop Agents (1 RDSH & 1 Server VDI)
* RDP JumpBox

After deployment, the components are fully configured and a simple XenApp site is created in a number of steps:

1. A new user-specified Active Directory domain is created and the machines are automatically joined to it.
2. A SQL server database is configured and a site is created on the XenApp Delivery Controller.
3. VDAs are provisioned and joined to the new site.
4. A StoreFront site is created, providing access to published Apps & Desktops.
5. A certificate is obtained for the deployment from the letsencrypt certificate authority.
6. NetScaler is configured as a gateway to the deployment.

# Pre-Requisites

		a. Navigate to "Identity and Access Management"
		b. Click "API Access"
		c. Enter a name for Secure Client and click Create Client.
		d. Once Secure Client is created, download Secure Client Credentials file.
		e. Note down id      => Passed as parameter for customerId
					 Secret  => Passed as parameter for clientSecret
